SSH - Secure shell --Passwordless Authentication

In order to achieve SSH connection,both the server should have same user name's.
If we want to make passwordless bidirectionally , we need to do
  1) same user (bhakya) in both the servers
  2) Generate ssh-keygen and copy it to another server and do vice versa

visudo ---give permission 
/home/user

useradd bhakya
passwd bhakya

List of users: cat /etc/passwd ---(should be as root user)
su -l bhakya -- switch to user
Visudo
add the user (replace the wheel to our user)

ctrl+D = logout
Shft+G = Go to last line in file
DD --delete the line in VI file

vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
without press Insert -----/password (serach the text in config file)
Uncomment the password Authentication yes
and comment the password Authentication No

service sshd restart -- inorder to reflect the above changes
Switch to user and do the below
ssh-keygen ---Generate Key file
cd /.ssh
ssh-copy-id private ip of server want to connect
ssh privateip ---we can connect that server without pwd

After copying ssh key, go to second server 
we can see the .ssh folder inside the user home directory
authorized keys
