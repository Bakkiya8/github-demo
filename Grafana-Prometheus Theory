Bridge between Jenkins and Grafana (Monitoring tool)

Promethus is a time series database which is designed to monitor targets like Servers,database,stand alone VM's

While Prometheus is mostly a metrics gathering tool, Grafana is used to potray those data in charts, thus providing a visual representation.

Grafana:

It is a open source multiplatform interactive visualization tool which provides graphs,charts and dashboards to end users.
